# Big Data Analysis of Air Pollution Index

This was my core project of the course ES 209 Data Analysis and Interpretation offered by Environmental Science and Engineering Department. We were given data from low cost sensors from Januray, 2020 to August 2020. This timescale covers pre-covid period, during covid period and some post covid period. We had to analyse and answer questions given to us.


## Data Set
Data from Low Cost Sensor was given from 5 different locations from Januray 2020, to August 2020. The data is present in this repository in the LCS Raw Data folder.

## Questions for Term Project
- Compare monthly averaged dataset for each location and for any one of the PM concentrations (PM1, PM2.5, PM10) [Hint: Use Anova and Tukey test; look for location-pair having maximum correlation; etc.]
- Compare phase averaged dataset for each location and for any one of the PM concentrations (PM1, PM2.5, PM10). Here, consider 3 phases (pre-lockdown phase, lockdown phase & unlock phase) [Hint: Use Anova and Tukey test; look for location-pair having maximum correlation; etc.]
- Study effect of lockdown (phase) on PM1, PM2.5 & PM10 concentration at each location.
- Plot daily averaged PM concentration (in PM1, PM2.5 & PM10 in same plot) for each
location. Comment any visible observation from the plot.
- Find whether temperature & PM concentration are (directly/inversely) correlated. [Hint:
use daily averaged dataset]

## Features

- Performed statistical tests including Time Series Graph, Average Plotted Graph, Particle Distribution Graph and Hypothesis Testing on the air pollution index data provided from various Covid-19 lockdown periods
- Used Anova and Turkey Test to find the location-pair having maximum correlation and analysed the relation between temperature and PM concentration by comparing the results from linear and multiple regression models
